    <h2>What Makes Me Stand Out</h2>
    <p>
      With a strong background in Business Analytics and hands-on experience at Careem Networks and EllisDon Corporation, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team. My time at Careem, where I joined during its early start-up phase, allowed me to explore various business areas and develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills while collaborating across departments such as sales, marketing, and business intelligence. This experience contributed to Careem’s rapid growth and its eventual acquisition by Uber.
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing my studies at Seneca College, I transitioned into my first professional role in Canada with EllisDon Corporation. This opportunity enabled me to apply my academic learning in a corporate setting, further developing my skills in understanding business requirements, optimizing workflows, and delivering actionable insights. Working across teams, I contributed to improving operational efficiency and organizational success, which reinforced my passion for data-driven problem-solving.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am motivated by solving real-world problems, helping people make informed decisions, and enabling economic opportunities through thoughtful and effective use of data. Whether it’s supporting operational improvements or driving strategic insights, I find purpose in creating solutions that have a measurable, positive impact on both individuals and organizations.

    <h2>Key achievements and projects throughout my professional career</h2>
    <h3>EllisDon</h3>
      <p>Fully automated the survey process—from filtering data and assigning services, to distributing surveys and building a Power BI report that sends email notifications when surveys are due.</p>
      <p>Optimized ETL pipelines for energy reports to enable faster, autonomous data collection and integrated government weather data into reporting databases for richer context and analysis.</p>

    <h3>Careem</h3>
      <p><strong>Compliance Project:</strong> Led the initial phase of the permit application process after Careem received its operating license. Designed workflows, managed driver data, and built linked databases to prioritize permits for high-performing drivers.</p>
      <p><strong>Scooter Drivers Acquisition:</strong> Recruited and analyzed scooter drivers in Jordan, showing improved delivery times and trips per hour. Collaborated with third parties to plan demand and launched installment plans to support new drivers and scooter delivery launch.</p>
      <p><strong>Geo-fenced Locations:</strong> Analyzed hundreds of thousands of GPS data points to identify high-density locations and created geo-fenced pick-up points on the app, enhancing customer experience by guiding riders to optimal pick-up spots.</p>
      <p><strong>Performance Project:</strong> Developed a weekly plan addressing peak-hour demand by forming a task force of high-performing drivers and motivating them with targeted in-app messages and incentives.</p>
