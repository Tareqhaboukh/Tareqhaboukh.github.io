    <h2>What Makes Me Stand Out</h2>
    <p>
      With a strong background in Business Analytics and hands-on experience at Careem Networks and EllisDon Corporation, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team. My time at Careem, where I joined during its early start-up phase, allowed me to explore various business areas and develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills while collaborating across departments such as sales, marketing, and business intelligence. This experience contributed to Careemâ€™s rapid growth and its eventual acquisition by Uber.
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing my studies at Seneca College, I transitioned into my first professional role in Canada with EllisDon Corporation. This opportunity enabled me to apply my academic learning in a corporate setting, further developing my skills in understanding business requirements, optimizing workflows, and delivering actionable insights. Working across teams, I contributed to improving operational efficiency and organizational success, which reinforced my passion for data-driven problem-solving.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am motivated by solving real-world problems, helping people make informed decisions, and enabling economic opportunities through thoughtful and effective use of data. Whether itâ€™s supporting operational improvements or driving strategic insights, I find purpose in creating solutions that have a measurable, positive impact on both individuals and organizations.

    <h2>Key achievements and projects throughout my professional career</h2>

    <h3>EllisDon Corporation</h3>
      <p><strong>Power BI Reporting Initiative:</strong> Led a Power BI initiative to build dashboards and create specific and complex reports that serve multiple sites based on their individual requirements, by gathering inputs from project agreements or directly communicating with site GMs. This enabled fast-paced, agile delivery of ad hoc reports.</p>
      <p><strong>Energy Reporting and ETL Optimization:</strong> Optimized ETL pipelines for energy reports to enable faster, autonomous data collection and integrated government weather data into reporting databases for richer context and analysis.</p>
      <p><strong>Survey Automation and Vendor Management:</strong> Managed the survey process and identified a new vendor after assessing multiple options to improve performance. Fully automated the process from filtering data and assigning services to distributing surveys and building a Power BI report that sends email notifications with the data ready to be shared when surveys are due.</p>

    <h3>Uber (Careem Networks)</h3>
      <p><strong>Compliance Project:</strong> Led the initial phase of the driver permit application process after Careem received its operating license. Designed workflows, managed driver data, and built databases linked to performance and quality teams to prioritize permits for high-performing drivers.</p>
      <p><strong>Scooter Delivery Launch:</strong> Analyzed scooter driver performance in Jordan, showing better delivery times and trips per hour compared to regular drivers. Worked with third parties to plan demand and helped introduce installment plans, making it easier for new drivers to join and supporting the scooter delivery launch.</p>
      <p><strong>Geo-fenced Locations:</strong> Analyzed hundreds of thousands of GPS data points to identify high-density locations and created geo-fenced pick-up points on the app, enhancing customer experience by guiding riders to optimal pick-up spots.</p>
      <p><strong>Performance Project:</strong> Developed a weekly plan addressing peak-hour demand by forming a task force of high-performing drivers and motivating them with targeted in-app messages and incentives.</p>

  <h2>Business Analytics Consulting Capstone Project</h2>

  <p>
    This project was completed as part of my final semester at Seneca College. It analyzed Canadian cell phone plans compared to U.S. offerings, with the goal of providing a data-driven assessment of how Canadian plans perform in terms of value, features, and cost. Our team developed a scoring model that incorporated both qualitative and quantitative data.
