    <h2>Why Me</h2>
    <p>
      With a strong background in Business Analytics and hands-on experience at Careem Networks and EllisDon Corporation, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team. My time at Careem, where I joined during its early start-up phase, allowed me to explore various business areas and develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills while collaborating across departments such as sales, marketing, and business intelligence. This experience contributed to Careem’s rapid growth and its eventual acquisition by Uber.
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing my studies at Seneca College, I transitioned into my first professional role in Canada with EllisDon Corporation. This opportunity enabled me to apply my academic learning in a corporate setting, further developing my skills in understanding business requirements, optimizing workflows, and delivering actionable insights. Working across teams, I contributed to improving operational efficiency and organizational success, which reinforced my passion for data-driven problem-solving.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am motivated by solving real-world problems, helping people make informed decisions, and enabling economic opportunities through thoughtful and effective use of data. Whether it’s supporting operational improvements or driving strategic insights, I find purpose in creating solutions that have a measurable, positive impact on both individuals and organizations.
