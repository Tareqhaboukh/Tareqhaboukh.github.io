  <h1>Careem's Data Breach: What I Learned from the Inside</h1>
  <p class="byline">By Tareq Haboukh<br>Originally written for "Security, Privacy and Ethics for Business Analytics" - March 29, 2022</p>
  <hr>

  <p>What started as a typical day at work turned into my first real-life experience dealing with a major cybersecurity incident. At the time, I was working at Careem’s Amman office. We were called into an urgent meeting where leadership addressed circulating rumors of a data leak and informed us that a public statement would be made the next day. They walked us through the possible consequences and reassured us that being transparent was the right course of action.</p>

  <p>On January 14, 2018, Careem, the leading ride-hailing app in the Middle East, experienced a cyberattack that compromised the data of approximately 14 million users and 558,000 Captains (Careem drivers). The hackers gained access to systems storing names, email addresses, phone numbers, and trip details. Careem disclosed the breach publicly on April 23, 2018, three months after it was discovered. Users who signed up after the breach date were not affected.</p>

  <p>The company issued an apology and emailed users with an explanation of what happened, how they responded, and what steps they were taking to prevent future incidents. While no financial data was accessed (as that data was stored on third-party PCI-compliant servers), Careem urged users to update their passwords and monitor their accounts.</p>

  <p>After discovering the breach, Careem launched an internal investigation and brought in cybersecurity experts to bolster its infrastructure. They introduced monitoring systems, implemented multi-factor authentication, and updated access controls. Despite the improvements, many questioned the three-month delay in disclosure, including security experts who argued that it gave attackers more time to exploit stolen data.</p>

  <p>The press also raised concerns about the breach’s implications, particularly for political figures, activists, and journalists whose trip information might have been exposed. Careem stated that they were cooperating with authorities but couldn’t share further details.</p>

  <p>Ethical hackers had reportedly warned Careem about security vulnerabilities as early as 2016, but their alerts were allegedly ignored. One hacker, Farooq Baloch, claimed that attempts were made via email, social media, and even direct meetings with executives. He argued that a small investment in a bug bounty program could have significantly improved security.</p>

  <p>Interestingly, Uber (which later acquired Careem) experienced a similar breach in 2016, affecting 57 million users and drivers. Uber paid the hackers $100,000 to delete the data—raising further ethical questions around how tech companies handle breaches.</p>

  <p>Looking back, I believe Careem made risky decisions early on by prioritizing rapid growth over long-term security. The breach forced a necessary shift in strategy. While the delay in disclosure remains controversial, I think the company’s eventual transparency and steps toward improvement were a turning point.</p>

  <p>This experience was eye-opening. It showed me how easy it is to overlook information security—even with the best intentions—and how critical it is for fast-growing companies to treat privacy and cybersecurity as foundational priorities.</p>
